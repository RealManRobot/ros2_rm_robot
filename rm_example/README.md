## rm_example_Package_Use
### Changing_the_work_coordinate_system
First, we need to run the underlying driver node of the robotic arm rm_driver.
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_driver rm_<arm_type>_driver.launch.py
```
In practice, the above <arm_type> needs to be replaced by the actual model of the robotic arm. The available models of the robotic arm are 65, 63, eco65, and 75.  
For example, the launch command of 65 robotic arm:
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_driver rm_65_driver.launch.py
```
After successfully launching the node, execute the following commands to replace the node in the work coordinate system.
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 run rm_example rm_change_work_frame
```
The following command pops up to indicate successful replacement.

Enter the following commands in the end for verification, first subscribe to the current work coordinate system topic.
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 topic echo /rm_driver/get_curr_workFrame_result
```
Then publish the request of the current coordinate system.
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 topic pub --once /rm_driver/get_curr_workFrame_cmd std_msgs/msg/Empty "{}"
```
You can see the following interface pop up at the end.

### Get_the_current_state_message_of_the_robotic_arm
First, we need to run the underlying driver node of the robotic arm rm_driver.
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_driver rm_<arm_type>_driver.launch.py
```
In practice, the above <arm_type> needs to be replaced by the actual model of the robotic arm. The available models of the robotic arm are 65, 63, eco65, and 75.  
For example, the launch command of 65 robotic arm:
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_driver rm_65_driver.launch.py
```
After successfully launching the node, execute the following commands to obtain the current state of the robotic arm node.
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 run rm_example rm_get_state
```
The following command pops up to indicate successful replacement.

What is displayed in the interface is the current angle message of the robotic arm, as well as the current end coordinate position and Euler angle posture message of the robotic arm.
### MoveJ_motion_of_the_robotic_arm
Through the following commands, we can control the joint MoveJ motion of the robotic arm.
First, we need to run the underlying driver node of the robotic arm rm_driver.
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_driver rm_<arm_type>_driver.launch.py
```
In practice, the above <arm_type> needs to be replaced by the actual model of the robotic arm. The available models of the robotic arm are 65, 63, eco65, and 75.  
For example, the launch command of 65 robotic arm:
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_driver rm_65_driver.launch.py
```
After successfully launching the node, execute the following commands to control the movement of the robotic arm.
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_example rm_<dof>_movej.launch.py
```
dof represents the current degree of freedom message of the arm, and the parameters can be selected as 6dof and 7dof.  
For example, when starting the 7-axis robotic arm, the following commands are needed.
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_example rm_7dof_movej.launch.py
```
After successful running, the joint of the robotic arm rotates and the interface displays as follows.

### MoveJ_P_motion_of_the_robotic_arm
Through the following commands, we can control the joint MoveJ_P motion of the robotic arm.  
First, we need to run the underlying driver node of the robotic arm rm_driver.
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_driver rm_<arm_type>_driver.launch.py
```
In practice, the above <arm_type> needs to be replaced by the actual model of the robotic arm. The available models of the robotic arm are 65, 63, eco65, and 75.  
For example, the launch command of 65 robotic arm:
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_driver rm_65_driver.launch.py
```
After successfully launching the node, execute the following commands to control the movement of the robotic arm.
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 run rm_example movejp_demo
```
After successful execution, the interface appears as follows, and the robotic arm will move to the specified pose.

### MoveL_motion_of_the_robotic_arm
Through the following commands, we can control the joint MoveL motion of the robotic arm.  
First, we need to run the underlying driver node of the robotic arm rm_driver.
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_driver rm_<arm_type>_driver.launch.py
```
In practice, the above <arm_type> needs to be replaced by the actual model of the robotic arm. The available models of the robotic arm are 65, 63, eco65, and 75.
For example, the launch command of 65 robotic arm:
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_driver rm_65_driver.launch.py
```
After successfully launching the node, execute the following commands to control the movement of the robotic arm.
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 run rm_example movel_demo
```
After successful execution, the interface appears as follows, and the robotic arm performs two motions. Firstly, it moves to the specified pose through MoveJP, and then performs joint motion through MoveL.
